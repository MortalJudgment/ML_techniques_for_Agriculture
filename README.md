## Introduction

Welcome to the Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning project! This README provides an overview of the project, details about the Jupyter Notebook files, the dataset used for crop recommendation, prerequisites, installation instructions, usage guidelines, features, how to contribute, licensing, and contact information.

## Project Overview

Crop recommendation is an essential task in agriculture. The application of machine learning techniques can help farmers make informed decisions about which crops to cultivate based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and historical data. This project focuses on building a crop recommendation system using machine learning.

## Notebook Files

The project includes Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate the crop recommendation system using machine learning:

1. **Data Visualization and Analysis.ipynb**: This notebook explores data visualization and analysis techniques for agriculture-related datasets. It provides insights into understanding and preprocessing agricultural data.

2. **ML Techniques for Agriculture.ipynb**: This notebook contains the crop recommendation system. It uses machine learning algorithms to recommend suitable crops based on input factors such as soil type, climate, and more.

## Dataset

To run the crop recommendation system, you will need the following dataset:

- **crop_recommendation.csv**: This dataset contains information about different crops and their requirements, including soil type, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop labels. It is used for training and testing the machine learning model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python Environment**: You should have a Python environment set up, preferably using Anaconda or a virtual environment.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip` or `conda`.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/MortalJudgment/ML_techniques_for_Agriculture.git
   
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory: cd agriculture-ml-project
   
5. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
- conda create --name agriculture-ml-env python=3.7
- conda activate agriculture-ml-env
  
4. Install the required libraries by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook

2. Open the "ML Techniques for Agriculture.ipynb" notebook in your web browser.

3. Follow the instructions and run the code cells within the notebook to perform crop recommendation based on input factors.

4. Ensure that the "crop_recommendation.csv" dataset file is in the same directory as the notebook.

5. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different input values, and explore the crop recommendation system.

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation**: Implement a crop recommendation system using machine learning algorithms.

- **Data Visualization**: Explore data visualization and analysis techniques for agricultural datasets.

- **Educational**: Each notebook provides detailed explanations and code comments to facilitate learning and application.
